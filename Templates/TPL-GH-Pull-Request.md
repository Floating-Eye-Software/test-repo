# **TPL – GitHub Pull Request Template**

## External Document

This document serves as the controlled metadata record for the GitHub pull
request template. The PR template itself cannot include QMS metadata without
displaying it in the GitHub UI; therefore metadata is maintained separately
here in compliance with Document-Control-SOP §6.8 (External Documents).
